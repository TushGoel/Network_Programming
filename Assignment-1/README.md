# Problem Description:

Exercise 1:
☐ Exercise 1 has a skeleton that has already been written. The original code is full of errors. Your task is to edit, compile and run the code without any errors.
☐ The conditions that you will have to satisfy are given in comments within the code.
☐ Follow the directions in the comments in the code, edit the code to get rid of errors without changing what the code is trying to achieve, run the installer without any errors and finally run the program to check if everything is working proper. Some errors can be fixed in multiple ways: unless specified, you can pick the one you prefer.

Exercise 2:
☐ Exercise 2 also has a skeleton that has already been written. But here there is no actual code in the skeleton.
☐ Your task is to follow the comments, write appropriate code to complete the tasks given in comments in the code, compile it without any errors and run the code.
